Analysis of the Quality of Films in the Last 10 Years

This project aims to identify the year, in the last 10, in which the most highly rated films were made. Using data from the IMDb database, I selected films made in the period from 2014 to 2023. I filtered the films based on ratings, taking into account the number of votes, and concluded that 2014 was the most successful year, which is shown in the bar chart. Also, a significant drop in the number of films in 2020 is noticeable, probably due to the coronavirus pandemic. After that we also notice a smaller number of highly rated films. We need to look for the cause of this, one of the answers might be a worse economic situation
